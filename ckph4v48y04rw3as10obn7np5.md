## Using Event Emitter in Node.js for event driven programming (For beginners).


When it comes to **Node.js**, one of its pros include that its best suited for Event driven programming. In this article, we’ll discover what event driven programming is & a few simple **examples** that showcase its usage in easiest way possible. By the way, what is this event driven approach? Let’s find out -

There are many **objects** in Node.js that emit events such as [**f](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_readstream)s.ReadStream()** emits an event whenever a **file** is opened. Any object that emits event is an **instance** of **EventEmitter** **class**. Let’s see how can we **import** events in our Node.js application -

***var events = require(“events”);***

And the way we can initialize an EventEmitter **class** is -

***var eventsEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();***

Pretty simple? Right? Well, in the examples to follow, we’ll be making use of Node.js **File System.** If you’re not aware of how to use File System, you can take a cue from [**here](https://topcoded.com/javascript/understanding-node-js-file-system-basic-ops-for-beginners/)**. Let’s begin with a very minimal **example** -

## Example

```
**var express = require('express');**

var router = express.Router();

var events = require('events');

var eventsEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();


// Defining an event.
eventsEmitter.on('test', () => {
  
    console.log('Test Event Successful!');
  
});


router.get('/', (req, res) => {

    //Subscribing to an event
    eventsEmitter.emit('test');

});


module.exports = router;
```


In this example, we’re firing up an event whenever ‘/’ route is hit. We can use **.emit()** method to initialize an event & the first **argument** it takes is the **name** of event. i.e **test** in this case. Now, we use **.on()** method to prescribe what happens when that particular event i.e **test** in this case, is fired up. This would yield the following **output** -

Easy? Alright, so let’s move on to the next level and make use of **File System** to **read** a file using event emitter.

```
**var express = require('express');**

var router = express.Router();

var events = require('events');

var fs = require('fs');

var eventsEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

eventsEmitter.on('read', (fileName) => {
  
    fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (error, data) => {
      
        if (error) {
          
            console.log(error);
          
        } console.log(data);
      
    });
  
});


router.get('/', (req, res) => {

    eventsEmitter.emit('read', 'testFile.txt');

});


module.exports = router;
```


In this example, we’re using **.emit()** method to fire up an event i.e **read** in this case. It takes the **name** of event as **first argument** & we can pass an object as **second** in case we want to use something in the function associated to that event. In this case we’re using **testFile.txt** that we want to read when the event is fired up. Using **.on()** method, we can set the **name** of event i.e **read** in this case & a function with parameter **fileName**. This will yield us the following output -

See? We just read a file using **Event Emitter.** Okay, so let’s move on to use **multiple events**. Consider the following example -

```
**var express = require('express');**

var router = express.Router();

var events = require('events');

var fs = require('fs');

var eventsEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();


eventsEmitter.on('read', readFileContent);

eventsEmitter.on('show', showData);

function readFileContent(fileName) {
  
    console.log(`Reading ${fileName} started!`);
  
    fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (error, data) => {
      
        if (error) {
          
            console.log(error);
          
        } eventsEmitter.emit('show', data);
      
    });
  
}


function showData(data) {
  
    console.log('-------- [ File Data ] ---------');
  
    console.log(data);
  
}


router.get('/', (req, res) => {

    eventsEmitter.emit('read', 'testFile.txt');

});


module.exports = router;
```


In this example, we’ve declared **two events** i.e **read** & **show**, executing **readFileContent** & **showData** functions respectively. Like in the previous example, we’re firing up **read** event from the get(‘/’) request along with the file name **testFile.txt**. We obtain this file name in **readFileContent** function using parameter i.e **fileName** in this case. When the **.readFile()** method of **File System** module returns the file data, we send it as **second parameter** along with calling of **show** event. This **show** event in turn will call the function **showData**. We obtain the file data in **showData’s** parameters & display it. Lets check its output -

So, in this way, we can use **multiple events** to handle events in parts in order to execute the functions more gracefully & in a controlled way. Okay so, let’s extend this tutorial to add one another **example** that can show us how to handle events on **conditional** basis. Let’s check that out -

```
**var express = require('express');**

var router = express.Router();

var events = require('events');

var fs = require('fs');

var eventsEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();


eventsEmitter.on('read', readFileContent);

eventsEmitter.on('show', showData);

eventsEmitter.on('check', checkData);

eventsEmitter.on('success', successFuction);

eventsEmitter.on('failed', failFunction);

eventsEmitter.on('finish', finishedFunction);

function readFileContent(fileName) {
  
    console.log(`Reading ${fileName} started!`);
  
    fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (error, data) => {
      
        if (error) {
          
            console.log(error);
          
        } eventsEmitter.emit('show', data);
      
    });
  
}


function showData(data) {
  
    console.log('-------- [ File Data ] ---------');
  
    console.log(data);
  
    eventsEmitter.emit('check', data);
  
}


function checkData(data) {
  
    console.log('-------- Scanning Data ---------');
  
    if (data.includes("virus")) {
      
        eventsEmitter.emit('success');
      
    } else {
      
        eventsEmitter.emit('failed');
      
    }
  
}


function successFuction() {
  
    console.log('Malware has been detected!');
  
    eventsEmitter.emit('finish');
  
}


function failFunction() {
  
    console.log('No virus detected!');
  
    eventsEmitter.emit('finish');
  
}


function finishedFunction() {
  
    console.log('-------- Scanning Completed Successfully --------');
  
}


router.get('/', (req, res) => {

    eventsEmitter.emit('read', 'testFile.txt');

});


module.exports = router;
```


Seems too much to get it all at once? Relax, we’ll split its explanation on point basis in order to get hold of what all is going on in there. So, let’s start -

1. Firstly, we’re firing up **read** event whenever get(‘/’) route is being hit. We pass along the **file name** to be used in this example i.e **testFile.txt** (Refer to line number 53).

1. Now, we have used **.on()** method to **assign functions** for each event fired up. (Refer from line number 7 to 12).

1. Like in previous example, we get the data in **showData** function. From here, we **emit** another event called **check** and pass along the **data**. (See line number 26).

1. In **checkData** function, we receive the **data** using parameter value. In this function, we’ll be checking if a **word** exists in the file we’ve just completed reading. Consider it as a **Malware detection program** :P

1. We’ll be using javascript’s **.includes()** method to check if a **substring** is present in a **string** or not. In this case we’ll be checking if our file data contains the work “**virus**” in it. (Refer to line number 31).

1. If the **substring** is present in the **string**, then event **success** is fired up. Otherwise, events **failed** is referred to. (Refer to lines 32 & 34).

1. Both the functions **successFunction** & **failedFunction** hits the finish event after their successful completion. (Refer to lines 40 & 45).

1. When **finish** event is fired up, it executes **finishedFunction** and is therefore the **end** of these events as there are no further events that have been subscribed to.

The above stated example will produce the output -

And if we include the word “**virus**” in our **testFile.txt**, it would result into this -

That was fun, right? There are plenty of other things that go around with **Event Emitters** but I wanted it to be as beginner friendly as it can, so may be, we’ll cover other areas of it in some upcoming article. So, that’s the way you can divide your Node.js **processes** into **individual events** & connect them in a fashion you want. I hope, it helped you to understand what’s going around with Event Emitters, or at least, it must have given you a start.
